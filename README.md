# Terms of Service - Progressy App

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using the Progressy app (the "App"), you agree to comply with and be legally bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, please do not use the App.

## 2. Subscriptions

### 2.1 Subscription Types
Progressy offers two types of subscriptions:

- **Monthly Subscription**: Billed monthly.
- **Yearly Subscription**: Billed annually.

Both subscription plans come with a **one-month free trial** for first-time subscribers.

### 2.2 Free Trial
New users are eligible for a one-month free trial. You will not be charged until the free trial period ends. To avoid being charged, you must cancel the subscription before the trial period expires. If not canceled, your selected subscription plan (monthly or yearly) will automatically renew and you will be charged according to your chosen plan.

### 2.3 Automatic Renewal
Subscriptions are automatically renewed at the end of each subscription period (monthly or yearly) unless canceled at least 24 hours before the current period ends. Your subscription will be renewed for the same duration and at the current rate unless otherwise specified.

You can manage your subscription and turn off auto-renewal by going to your account settings after purchase.

### 2.4 Payment
Payment for subscriptions will be charged to your iTunes Account at confirmation of purchase. Subscription renewals will be charged 24 hours prior to the end of the current subscription period. Prices may vary by location and are subject to change. Any changes in price will be communicated to you in advance, and you will have the option to cancel your subscription before the new rates apply.

### 2.5 Refund Policy
All payments made are non-refundable. Once a subscription is purchased, you will not be entitled to any refund for any unused portion of the subscription. Please note that deleting the app or unsubscribing will not trigger an automatic refund.
